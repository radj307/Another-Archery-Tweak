Another Archery Tweak Requiem Edition 
(Standalone - Does not require, and is incompatible with main file)

! Load after Requiem.esp



Applies all the same consistency tweaks to flags as the main versions.
Applies all the same stealth detection tweaks as the main versions.
Changes Elven Bloodcursed Arrows to use 0 gravity as they're only ever shot at the sun. 

The Requiem version is unique in that it has different gravity values for arrows & bolts.
All gravity values have been lowered by < 0.2 | This should straighten the trajectory out at the beginning of the arc to be consistent with the speed values.
Lowers the speed of crossbow bolts from 262FPS to 234FPS
- This is faster than the average projectile velocity of a Crossbow in the medieval period, but I felt lowering it too far would screw with the physics in Requiem.
Raises the speed of arrows from 168FPS to 201FPS
- This is closer to the average projectile velocity of a Recurve Bow in the medieval period.


As of v2.0.2, the Requiem version also comes with (some) addons!
