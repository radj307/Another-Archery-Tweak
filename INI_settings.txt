Another Archery Tweak - INI Tweaks


Add/Replace the following lines in your Skyrim.ini & (if applicable) SkyrimCustom.ini:

[Combat]
f1PArrowTiltUpAngle=0.2
f1PboltTiltUpAngle=0.2
f3PArrowTiltUpAngle=0.7
fMagnetismLookingMult=-0.0
fMagnetismStrafeHeadingMult=-0.0










			(Explanation following if you're interested)










	What do these settings do?
		Lining up fired arrows/bolts with your crosshair/screen center in 1st & 3rd person:
				f1PArrowTiltUpAngle=0.2
				f1PboltTiltUpAngle=0.2
				f3PArrowTiltUpAngle=0.7
		
		Stop arrows from impacting targets they pass in close proximity:
				fMagnetismLookingMult=-0.0
				fMagnetismStrafeHeadingMult=-0.0
				
			You can use either 0.0 or -0.0 here, but personally I've had more success with -0
				(Detailed explanation below if you're interested)



	(Magnetism value explanation)
				
				Normally we would consider -0 to not be valid. However, with computer code this works a little differently.
				Since the first character of the line is 'f', this means the value is a floating-point variable, often called a "float".
				Floating-point variables are capable of holding "real" numbers in both positive and negative. 
				To give you an idea as to why a float can be either a 0 or a -0 consider the following 
				32-bit representations of 2 float values below:
				
						0 00000000 00000000000000000000000
						1 00000000 00000000000000000000000
						^	  ^				  ^
					  sign   exponent	   fraction
					  
				As you can see, the only difference between these values is the first, or "sign" bit. The sign bit is used to determine 
				whether a value is positive or negative, which is why a float can be -0.
				
				I've been playing around with the magnetism ini setting for a while, and based on my testing, 
				a magnetism value of 0 does not appear to actually turn off magnetism entirely. I tried using a negative value here, but it 
				(somewhat obviously) caused arrows to miss, even when they had visibly impacted the target.
				And that's why I tried using -0.0, which on my system, appears to have actually worked! 
				(Likely due to the game engine not expecting -0 to be a possible input, but this doesn't cause any instability.)
