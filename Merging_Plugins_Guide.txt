Another Archery Tweak - Merging Plugins Guide


METHOD 1: zEdit (Automatic)
	DIFFICULTY: 
		Very Easy
		
	REQUIREMENTS:
		zEdit	( https://github.com/z-edit/zedit/releases )
		All AAT .esp files active at the bottom of your load order.
		
	PROCESS:
		1.	Open zEdit, select "zMerge" & "Skyrim SE" from the dropdown, then click "Start Session"
		2.	Click the green "Create Merge" button at the bottom
		3.	A popup will open with 4 tabs labelled "Details", "Plugins", "Load Order", & "Data"
		4.	In the Details tab, replace "New Merge" with a mod name of your choice, I recommend "AAT Merged"
		5.	Replace the Filename with "Another_Archery_Tweak.esp"
		6.	Select "Clean - Merge down (improved)" from the dropdown.
		7.	In the Plugins tab, select ALL of the Another_Archery_Tweak plugins.
		8.	In the Load Order tab, check the "Use game load order" box.
		9.	(optional) 	In the Data tab, open "General Assets" and check the "Copy General Assets" box.
						(This will copy the readme files into the merged mod folder)
		10.	Click "OK" at the bottom of the pop-up window, then find the newly created Merge in the list.
		11.	Next to your newly created merge name, click the "Build" button, and wait for it to finish.
		12.	Once done, exit zEdit. (It will automatically save the merge as a new mod folder.)
		13.	If you use Mod Organizer 2 (HIGHLY recommended) press F5 to refresh your mod list, there will be a new
			folder at the bottom with the name you gave it in zEdit. Copy the "Meta.ini" file from the original AAT
			folder into your merged folder, then delete the original mod. You will now use the merge folder to
			activate/deactivate AAT.
			If you do NOT use MO2, do the equivalent process for your preferred mod manager.
		14.	Run LOOT & make sure AAT is loaded after any of the mods you have patches for.


METHOD 2: xEdit (Manual)
