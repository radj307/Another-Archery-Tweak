# Another_Archery_Tweak-SSE
Modifies projectile's speed, gravity, and impact force to give arrows a more realistic feeling.
All values are based on real-life archery equipment performance, then scaled up slightly to improve gameplay.

Also patches a number of bugs in vanilla projectile records, which are not included in other similar mods, such as:
arrows randomly alerting NPCs even when far away or behind a wall,
ragdolls/objects over-reacting to projectile impacts,
missing sound effects for both arrows and bolts,
and the static ballista traps in Dwemer ruins.
